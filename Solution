From the problem description, we can see that each sock has only 1 or 0 matches. IE a list [1, 1, 1] would have only a single pair, rather than 3 unique pairs that
could be made. If we extrapolate this logic to larger lists, we see that the number of pairs of a certain color sock would be equal to the floor division by two of 
the number of socks of that color. For example, [1, 1, 1, 1] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] would both have only two pairs. 

The python solution to this problem looks something like this. 

def sockMerchant(n, ar):
  pairs = 0
  counts = {}
  
  for x in ar:
    if x not in counts.keys():
      counts[x] = 1
    elif x in counts.keys():
      counts[x] += 1
  
  for item in counts:
    pairs += item // 2
return pairs
